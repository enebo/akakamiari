Purpose of this project: 
  Seamless integration between Rake and Ant environments.

Quick Start:
  To run examples cd into them and do a command-line like:

  ANT_HOME=/opt/local/share/java/apache-ant jruby -I../lib simple_compile.rb 

  In time the detectedion of ANT_HOME will be magic (or shipped) and also
  the examples will also contain

More info:
1. Allow Rakefiles to call ant tasks
    ant.java(:classname => "org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManager", :fork => "yes") do
      classpath :refid => "project.class.path"
      arg :value => "-driver"
      arg :value => "org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver"
      arg :value => "-url"
      arg :value => "jdbc:hsqldb:#{data_dir}/music"
      arg :value => "-user"
      arg :value => "sa"
    end

2. Allow Rakefiles to be executed from ant.  This will be a simple Ant Task 
   along the lines of: '<rake_import file="Rakefile"/>'.  A second task may
   be '<rake file="Rakefile"/>'.  

   In the case of rake_import we are merely loading the tasks defined in the 
   Rakefile but we will not be calling any task explicitly.  Any tasks 
   encountered will be registered as ant tasks in ant's dependency graph.

   The rake task will just execute the Rakefile like you were calling it
   from the command-line.

3. The same as number 2, but the other direction:
   ant_import 'build.xml'
   ant 'build'xml'
